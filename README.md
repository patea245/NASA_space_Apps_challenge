# NASA_space_Apps_challenge
The DSCOVR challenge is focused on using open-source data on the magnetic field and flux and flow strength collected from the DSCOVR satellite to analyze the prediction of future storms based on flux and flow strength and to analyze the change in the accuracy of the data as the satellite reached and passed its mission length expectancy. Our team aimed to use an LSTM (long short-term memory), which is a type of RNN(Recurrent Neural Network). This neural network aims to tackle the problem of variations in the inputs and outputs of the network with time. The LSTM Model used for this challenge aims to solve both the prediction and satellite data accuracy problems as well. We predicted the future values, and also compared results predicted for years between 2020 and 2023 with the real data collected in that time. This comparison lets us see how the accuracy of the satellite's sensors has changed over time and how they might be causing anomalies to occur in collected data. Our solution checks the accuracy of the satellite and predicts the future values for Kp, which is the intensity of a storm. If the Kp is low then there is either no storm or a low-intensity storm, and with high values of Kp there are more intense storms occuring.
